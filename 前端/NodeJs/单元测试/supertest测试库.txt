1. Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API.
2. You may pass an http.Server, or a Function to request() - if the server is not already listening for connections then it is bound to an ephemeral port 	for you so there is no need to keep track of ports.
3. SuperTest works with any test framework, here is an example without using any test framework at all.
