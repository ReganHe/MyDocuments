xcopy problem ¨C Invalid drive specification ¨C 0 File(s) copied

The problem was, that I didn¡¯t have specified drive at all, because I was using UNC path (\\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource).
So, xcopy is reporting with the wrong error message.

In my situation, error was caused by broken network connection. Issuing:
net use \\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource /USER:user_name password
right before xcopy, fixed the problem.
